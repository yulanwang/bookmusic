# AI Assistant - Music Generator

**Inspiration**
I love reading, and I'm always finding something to listen to when reading that fit exactly the vibe of the book.

**What it does**
This project lets the users(readers) enter a book they're reading, then listen to corresponding music that fits the themes and overall feeling of the book.

**How it's built**
Built in Python using Streamlit. We used OpenAi and Suno's APIs to generate our content.
